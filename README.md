**YouTube Classic Polymer** is an extension that restyles YouTube's polymer layout to look like the old design from around 2015.

In addition to that, it also gives you some options, such as:
- Disabling the miniplayer
- Static thumbnails instead of live previews
- Collapsing the guide menu by default
- Using the 2015 logotype

*Note: This extension will not disable polymer.*

## How to install
Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/lassekongo83/yt-classic-polymer/releases/) and follow the instructions.
